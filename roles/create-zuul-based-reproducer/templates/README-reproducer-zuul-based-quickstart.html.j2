<title>WARNING - WIP - NOT FOR GENERAL USE - README for Quickstart Job Zuul-based Reproducer Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> WARNING - WIP - NOT FOR GENERAL USE - How to reproduce a job result using the Zuul-based reproducer playbooks and script</h1>
<p>Check the top-level logs directory for a tar file <b>reproducer-zuul-based-quickstart.tar</b>.
This tar archive contains three files:
<ul>
<li><code>launcher-env-setup-playbook.yaml</code> - a playbook to clone repos and set up
an Ansible environment to launch jobs</li>
<li><code>launcher-playbook.yaml - a playbook that installs and starts up Zuul, Gerrit and
other required services, and also creates and launches a reproducer job using
the same dlrn hashes as in CI</code></li>
<li><code>reproducer-zuul-based-quickstart.sh - a Bash script to provide an interface
to run the above playbooks with various options</code></li>
</ul>
Running these playbooks will set up Zuul, Gerrit, and related services in containers
on the local system, and will then create a reproducer job which can be run on a
cloud personal tenant or via libvirt on the local system.
If no <b>reproducer-zuul-based-quickstart.tar</b> file is found, that usually means an
infra failure before Quickstart could start or a problem in collecting logs.
Check on IRC Freenode channel <i>#tripleo</i> to see if there's an ongoing infra
issue.</p>

<h1>Setting up to run the Zuul-based reproducer</h1>
<p>
Prior to running the Zuul-based reproducer, the following setup steps are needed -
( only need to be done once per local system):
<ul>
<li>Create a clouds.yaml - for example:
<pre>
<code>mkdir -p ~/.config/openstack
vi ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
clouds:
  rdo-cloud:
        identity_api_version: 3
        region_name: regionOne
        auth:
          auth_url: https://phx2.cloud.rdoproject.org:13000/v3
          password: xxxxxxx
          project_name: user_name
          username:  user_name
          user_domain_name: Default
          project_domain_name: Default
        regions:
          - name: regionOne
            values:
              networks:
                - name: 38.145.32.0/22
                  routes_externally: true
                - name: private
</code>
</pre>
Note that you will need a network named 'private' in the tenant connected to an
external router.</li>
<li>Create an ssh key pair without a pass phrase:
The ssh key pair is configurable - see variables <code>ssh_path</code> and
<code>user_pri_key</code>. The default key is:<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa[.pub]</code></li>
<li>Check that you have access to the publicly shared nodepool images:
There should be one image for CentOS 7, and one for Fedora 28.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Running the Zuul-based reproducer - using the Bash script</h1>
<p>
wget the <b>reproducer-zuul-based-quickstart.tar</b> file. Note that
the <code>launcher-env-setup-playbook.yaml</code> will set up
clone repos and set up 'roles', 'playbooks', and 'library' directories
from which the tasks will be executed.
Once the files are extracted from the archive, you can run the Bash script
with the various options. Run the script with <code>--help</code> option to
output a list of available run options.
</p>

<h1>Running the Zuul-based reproducer - using the playbooks directly</h1>
<p>
The Bash script is not required although it is the supported path.
The playbooks can be run directly using <code>ansible-playbook</code>.
The Bash script contains some package installation and Docker user/group setup
that you will need to cover prior to running the playbooks directly.
Please see the Bash scripts for details, especially if you are running the
reproducer for the first time on teh local environment.
The playbooks can be run as follows:
<ul>
<li><code>ansible-playbook ./launcher-env-setup-playbook.yaml</code></li>
<li><code>ansible-playbook ./launcher-playbook.yaml $OPTIONS</code></li>
</ul>
The <code>launcher-playbook.yaml</code> includes comments on how to run the playbook
with the same options listed in the Bash script section above.
</p>

<h1>Ansible tags and running repeatedly</h1>
<p>
The Bash scripts runs with <code>--tags all</code> passed to the
<code>launcher-playbook.yaml</code>.
After the initial docker setup has run, it is not necessary to run through
those setup steps for every reproducer. The <code>launcher-playbook.yaml</code>
can be run with <code>--skip-tags start</code> after the initial run.
</p>

<h1>Monitoring the launched job</h1>
<p>
The <code>launcher-playbook.yaml</code> will create and push a job
to a test1 testproject repo in a temp directory. This job will start and the
related Zuul infrastructure logs can be viewed in:</br>
<pre>
<code>cd ~/tripleo-ci-reproducer
docker-compose logs --tail=10 -f
# Just view the scheduler and executor logs:
docker-compose logs --tail=10 -f scheduler executor</code>
</pre>
</br>
To see the job progress, you can access the web consoles of:
<ul>
<li>Gerrit: http://localhost:8080</li>
<li>Zuul: http://localhost:9000</li>
<li>Logs: http://localhost:8000</li>
</ul>
If you are accessing a remote machine, replace <code>localhost</code> with the ip address.
</p>

<h1>User notes</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Gerrit keys<br/>
If your ssh keys have being created with a new version of OpenSSH, Zuul will
fail when running with these keys as there is a Paramiko bug [1].
It is recommended  that keys be generated as follows:
<code>ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa</code> - accepting the passwordless option.
Then update the public keys used with Gerrit upstream and RDO Gerrit.</br>
