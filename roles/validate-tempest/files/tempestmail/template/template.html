        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>This is an automated email with tempest results for job <b>{{ data.get('job') }}</b>.</p>
        <p>The job ran on {{ data.get('date')|datetimeformat }}.</p>
        {% if 'Not available yet' not in data.get('link') %}
            <p>The logs are being uploaded, and it will be available soon. Usually, it take between 5 and 10 minutes to became available, depending of the amount of data it's being uploaded, so don't worry if you don't see the logs right now.</p>
            <p>Once the logs are available, you can check clicking <a href="{{ data.get('link') }}">here</a></p>
            <p>Mostly jobs upstream provides a tool to easily visualize and analyze the performance and execution of each tempest job.</p>
            <p>This tool is called stackviz, and you can see the results <a href="{{ data.get('link') }}logs/stackviz/">here</a> if available</p>
        {% else %}
            <p>Unfortunate the script that send this email wasn't able to find the url where the logs are. Perhaps wasn't passed</p>
            <p>to the script, or something wrong happened. If you think it's a mistake, please contact us on irc.freenode.org</p>
            <p>on channel #tripleo if it's related to a upstream job, or if you're using this service in your own infrastructure,</p>
            <p>be sure you are setting the environment variable LOG_PATH in your job.</p>
        {% endif %}
        <p>Below you can see a resume of the tempest execution for this particular job:</p>
    {% if 'new' in data and data.new %}
    <h2><font color="red">New failures ({{ data.new|length}}):</font></h2>
    <p>These are new failures for this particular run, some action is needed in order to fix it</p>
    <ul>
    {% for fail in data.new %}
        <li>{{ fail }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
    {% if 'covered' in data and data.covered %}
    <h2>Known failures ({{ data.covered|length }}):</h2>
    <p>These are known failures, and should have a launchpad or a bugzilla opened for it.</p>
    <ul>
    {% for fail in data.covered %}
    <li>{{ fail.failure }} - {{ fail.reason }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
    {% if ('has_errors' in data and 'run' in data) and not data.has_errors and data.run %}
    <h2><font color="green">Job ran successfully!</font></h2>
    <p>We consider a successfull run even if it has Known failures, since these are covered.</p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if not data.run %}
    <h2><font color="red">There's no tempest results!</font></h2>
    <p>This means that the TripleO installation might have finished sucessfully, however, tempest either fail before tests started, or didn't ran at all.</p>
    <p>One of the places to begin check is <a href="{{ data.get('link') }}logs/undercloud/home/jenkins/">here</a> (the link might don't exist depending of the type of error)
    {% endif %}
